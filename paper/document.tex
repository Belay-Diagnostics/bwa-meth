\section{Summary:}
We introduce a new tool, \textit{bwa-meth}, to align bisulfite-treated
sequences and compare it to existing aligners. We show that it is fast
and accurate even without quality-trimming and 
the output is immediately usable by downstream tools.
We gauge accuracy by comparing the number of on and off-target
reads from a targeted sequencing project and by simulations.

\section{Availability and Implementation:}

\section{Introduction}
Bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) is a common way to explore DNA methylation status.
As a result, software \citep{frithlast,methylcoder,gsnap,krueger2011,bsmap,bsmooth}
have been developed to map sequence reads treated with bisulfite to a reference genome.
Many of these rely on global alignment which performs best when the reads are quality-trimmed
before use. Previous studies have compared alignment statistics on 
real \citep{methylcoder,bsmap,shrestha} and simulated \citep{frithlast} reads,
however most of these are limited by knowledge of the ground-truth and assumptions of
the simulation, respectively.

Here, we present an analysis of current BS-Seq mappers including the "four-base" aligners
Last \citep{frithlast}, GSNAP \citep{gsnap} and BSMAP \citep{bsmap} as well as the
"three-base" aligners BSmooth \citep{bsmooth}, Bison, and Bismark \citep{krueger2011} which
perform \emph{in silico} conversion of cytosines to thymines. In addtion, we introduce our
own, simple three-base aligner that wraps \textit{BWA mem} \citep{bwamem}.

The comparison is performed on 100-base paired-end reads
which are of modest length by current standards, but, to our knowledge, longer than
utilized in any comparison. We hypothesized that long, paired reads, with up
to 200 bases from the same genomic region, could change the decision on which
alignment method performed the best. 
We found limitations to exisiting aligners including the writing of large temporary
files, required quality-trimming, high memory-use, long run-time, output that was not
suitable for consumption by traditional tools, or some combination of these
inconveniences. We wrote
a BS-Seq aligner based on BWA mem \citep{bwamem} to address these
limitations. This new aligner, 
\textit{bwa-meth}, allows indels, local alignments, and it never writes a
temporary-file of the reads to disk, instead streaming the \emph{in silico} converted
reads directly to the aligner and streaming the alignments directly to a well-formatted
alignment file suitable for use in downstream tools. In addition, it works well without
quality-trimming, thereby reducing storage requirements 3-fold by not creating
quality-trimmed or converted reads.

\section{Approach}
We introduce a novel approach for determining the accuracy of an aligner;
we utilize a dataset from Agilent's SureSelect Mouse Methyl-Seq kit which
captures about
99 million bases from high CpG-density regions in the mouse genome (a similar
approach is available for human regions).
We gauge an aligner by the number of reads in the capture area as compared
to outside of the capture area. While there will be off-target capture, all
aligners are subject to the same assumptions. With those constraints, we can
plot a receiver operating curve (ROC) with true positives as reads within
and false positives as reads outside of the target regions.
\citealp{shrestha} performed a similar unbiased analysis on 35 base reads sequenced from
the X chromosome and gauged a read as accurately mapped if it aligned
to the X chromosome; here, we map to the entire genome with 100-base paired-end reads.

In addition, we perform simulations with 100-base paired-end reads using
Sherman (v0.1.6), the software from the authors of Bismark. All data were
aligned to mouse genome version \textit{mm10}.

\begin{methods}
\section{Methods}
We aligned real and simulated data, both as-is and trimmed by quality (using Trim Galore
[\href{http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim\_galore/}{http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim\_galore/}]
default parameters), using the software and versions in Supplemental Table 1.
We evaluated a few parameters for each method and report only the
best-performing here. Likely, every aligner could show improved results with
exhaustive selection of the parameters, but this is a fair representation of
what we understand to be reasonable selections.
We considered a real read to be in the target region if it was within 1001 bases
of the target area.

\end{methods}

\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}

While \textit{bwa-meth} can align single-end reads, it has been optimized for
paired-end reads from the directional protocol, we show its utility here on real
and simulated data. Since it consists
of fewer than 600 lines of code (10-fold less than other aligners) and runs
quickly, it can be used as a platform to test other optimizations. For example
in Supplemental Figure 5, we show a feature that further reduces the
number of off-target reads by considering only the single strand targetted by
the SureSelect protocol.

\subsection{Accuracy}
For the aligners that report a range of mapping quality
scores--an indicator of the aligner's confidence in the alignment--
we vary the score from 1 to the maximum, 255, to draw an ROC-like
curve showing the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. For the
other aligners, we plot their single location. Figure \ref{fig:01} shows
the on and off-target reads for our real paired-end data. Last and 
\textit{bwa-meth} align the most reads on target with a low percent
of off-target reads, but Last provides better control over the number
of off-target reads. On trimmed data, Bison performs very well and has
even fewer off-target reads than Last.
Bismark performance varies depending on whether it uses bowtie version
1 or 2 for the backend but in either case, (as with all of the bowtie-backed
aligners) it performs better with trimmed reads.

Similar comparisons are shown in Supplemental Figures 2
for trimmed data and for simulated data in Supplemental Figures 3 and 4.
\textit{Bwa-meth} does out-perform Last (along with the other aligners)
for simulated data.

\subsection{Computational Resources}
Within reason, we are more interested in the accuracy of a
method than the speed. In general the aligners are comparable in terms of
speed. While Bismark with bowtie1 is quite fast on the simulated data it
can not use multiple processes and so takes the longest user-time. Bsmap
takes the longest CPU time on the real data. We report the exact 
timings and maximum memory use in Supplemental Information.
Bsmap uses the least disk, never writing an index of the reference genome
and only writing the alignment files. All other aligners write an index of
the reference genome. Last, bsmooth, and bismark write additional copies of the
reads to disk. This is to aid in parallelization in the case of Last and to
write the \emph{in silico} converted reads in the case of bismark and bsmooth.
While these could be addressed in either case, they are considerations
at the time of writing as are the output formats which require varying degrees
of post-processing to be using by other tools.
In addition, if an aligner must write trimmed and converted copies of the
sequence data, this increases the storage requirements enough to be a
burden in our experience. \textit{Bwa-meth} avoids writing the \emph{in silico}
converted reads to disk by streaming them directly to the aligner and works
well without read-trimming.
None of the programs used an inordinate amount of memory, however, due to
the parallelization strategy, Last did require about 10GB of shared memory
per process.

\section{Conclusion}
We have shown that \textit{bwa-meth} is very accurate, even without quality
trimming. Aligners that use global alignment benefit more from quality trimming
and also require an additional copy of the \emph{in silico} converted reads.
We have utilized a new technology that captures CpG-rich regions to compare
accuracy and speed of \textit{bwa-meth} to existing aligners.
It demonstrates greater accuracy than other aligners, it outputs mapping quality
scores and outputs an alignment file which is immediately usable by downstream
tools.
